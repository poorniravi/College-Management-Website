<p class="post-info">
The undulating terrain of the site as one approaches the foothills of the Western Ghats, 
offered an excellent opportunity to plan a split level campus with interesting external spaces such as terraces and stepped walkways complementing 
the buildings. 
This also helped minimize the impact of building on a natural slope - without disturbing 
surface water flows across the site and in preserving the other natural features such as mounds, rock formations etc.
 The campus which is about 110 acres in area houses two colleges, one an engineering college and the other an arts and science college.
 The site is a south facing slope overlooking small hillocks.
 A four lane roadway which runs towards the top of the slope connects the college campuses to National Highway 47. 
 It intersects at critical locations with the pedestrian network through which all faculty buildings are accessed. 
 It also connects with a system of discreetly hidden service roads to access the various facilities.
 The academic areas are located in the lower reaches away from the main road while the community facilities are generally located above this road with easy access to outsiders.
